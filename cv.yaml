about: '\vspace{18pt} \small{
  I research the capabilities of \textbf{Large Language Models} to address issues emerging from \textbf{online discussions},
  including NLP-based \textbf{toxicity mitigation}, \textbf{social media simulation} with LLM agents, and \textbf{argument mining} from \textbf{Reddit}.
  My foundational NLP experience (during my PhD) includes self-supervised text-to-text transformers for NLG. 
  More generally, I am interested in applications of \textbf{ML} and I am always curious in learning new topics in computer science and engineering.'

    title: Postdoctoral Researcher
    dates: 2023 -- 2025
    # dates: June 2018 -- Sept 2018
    details:
      - "Developed novel methods in the Distributed Information Systems Laboratory (Prof. Karl Aberer) to transform unstructured online news and social media data into structured, actionable insights."
      - "Designed SAGESSE, a System for Argument Generation, Extraction and Structuring of Social Exchanges that leverages the capabilities of open-weight LLMs (Mistral 7B and Microsoft Phi-3 14B) to organize complex online arguments."
      - "Fine-tuned OLMo-2 32B (AllenNLP's LLM) with LoRa/QLoRa on Reddit conversations, enabling simulation of online discussions through LLM-based agents conditioned with socio-demographic profiles inferred from real user histories."
      - "Supervised 6 Master’s students as primary advisor and 15 as secondary supervisor, providing mentorship, guidance, and evaluation on research projects."

    # dates: June 2018 -- Sept 2018
    details:
      - "Conducted research with the Data, Intelligence and Graphs team (Prof. Thomas Bonald) on leveraging pretrained deep learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the quality of online interactions."
      - "Implemented CAE-T5, a Conditional Auto-Encoder fine-tuning Google’s T5-3B model in a self-supervised setup, enabling rephrasing of negative reviews into positive ones and, for the first time, transforming aggressive comments into polite versions."
      - "Developed a recommender system grounded in textual online reviews, focusing on explainability of user tastes. The method represents user preferences as a graph of textual snippets, with edges defined by semantic similarity models."
